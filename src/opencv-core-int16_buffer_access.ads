package OpenCV.Core.Int16_Buffer_Access is

   type Buffer_Array is array (Natural range <>) of Int16_Value;

   --  Invokes Process with a zero-copy view of a continuous Int16 C1
   --  Mat of any dimension count; genuine N-D Mats are supported.
   --  Data directly aliases native OpenCV storage for the entire
   --  logical buffer; no pixel values are copied. The explicitly
   --  aliased callback formal guarantees that Data is passed by
   --  reference and directly denotes the borrowed Mat for the duration
   --  of Process. The ordinary lifetime of the view is the callback.
   --  Data is one flat array of Mat elements in OpenCV element order,
   --  final dimension varying fastest. For a nonempty
   --  buffer, Data'First = 0, Data'Last = Natural (Image.Total) - 1, and
   --  Data'Length = Natural (Image.Total). For Shape (D1, ..., Dn),
   --  zero-based index (I1, ..., In) is Data offset
   --  ((I1 * D2 + I2) * D3 + ...) * Dn + In. For a 2-D Mat, element
   --  Data (Row * Image.Columns + Column) denotes Image (Row, Column).
   --  A correctly typed empty Mat still invokes Process once. Its array
   --  has Data'Length = 0 and the null range 1 .. 0, so no element may
   --  be indexed.
   --  There are no row separators, padding, or gaps. Image must be
   --  continuous (Is_Continuous); a nonempty non-continuous Mat, such
   --  as a gapped Region or Slice, raises OpenCV_Error before Process
   --  is invoked. A continuous Region or N-D Slice is accepted even
   --  when it is a submatrix. The implementation holds one shallow Mat
   --  lease for the callback so referenced storage cannot disappear
   --  merely because another header is rebound or finalized. That lease
   --  is deterministic memory management, not thread synchronization.
   --  Do not retain a reference or address of Data after Process
   --  returns. Read-only access performs no copy; if another alias
   --  mutates the shared storage during the callback, Data observes
   --  those changes according to ordinary aliasing rules.

   --  As With_Read_Only_Buffer, including the nonempty zero-based range
   --  and the empty 1 .. 0 null range, except Process receives an in-out
   --  view.
   --  Writes through Data mutate the actual Mat storage immediately.
   --  There is no write-back phase. A write through Data is visible
   --  through Image and any shallow alias before Process returns, and
   --  a write through another alias is immediately visible through
   --  Data. Exceptions raised by Process propagate unchanged; any
   --  writes completed before the exception remain visible.
